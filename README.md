# Modernizing Business License Data Management via AWS

## Project Title:
AWS Data Analytic Platform for the City of Vancouver (Phase 1)


## Objective:
To design and implement a scalable, cost-efficient AWS-based Data Analytics Platform (DAP) for the City of Vancouver to manage and analyze business license data for 2024.

## Dataset:
Business license datasets containing:
- Business categories
- License types
- Geographic information
- Issuance dates and fees
 
## Methodology:

1. **Data Ingestion**  
   - Collect raw datasets and store in Amazon S3.
   
2. **Data Profiling**  
   - Use AWS Glue DataBrew to detect inconsistencies, missing values, and data structure issues.

3. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handle duplicates and formatting errors using AWS Glue ETL.

4. **Data Cataloging**  
   - Organize metadata in AWS Glue Data Catalog for easy access via Athena or Redshift.

5. **Data Summarization**  
   - Aggregate key metrics (e.g., licenses issued by type, revenue, region) to extract insights.

## Tools and Technologies:
- AWS S3
- AWS Glue & Glue DataBrew
- Amazon Athena
- Amazon EC2
- Amazon Cloudwatch

## Project Deliverables

### ðŸ§± DAP (Data Analytic Platform) Design 

To support the end-to-end data pipeline for business license analysis, a two-layer architecture was designed using AWS services. Below are two system diagrams that illustrate the infrastructure and data flow.

### Implementation Summary

## 1. Data Ingestion

- Initiated the AWS analytics pipeline with structured data ingestion.
- Uploaded raw business license datasets into **Amazon S3**.
- Ensured centralized, secure, and scalable data storage.
- Enabled easy access for downstream processes such as:
  - Data profiling
  - Data cleaning
  - Querying and analysis

1.1 Shows the successful upload of `business-list.csv` to the S3 bucket.

## 2. Data Profiling

- Used **AWS Glue DataBrew** to examine the structure and quality of ingested datasets.
- Analyzed three datasets: business list, license list, and location list.
- Key profiling outputs:
  - Total rows, columns, and data types
  - Percentage of missing and duplicate cells
  - Correlation matrices showing variable relationships
- Identified early data issues to guide the cleaning phase and ensure reliable analytics.

## 3. Data Cleaning

- Used **AWS Glue and AWS Glue DataBrew** to clean and prepare datasets for analysis.
- Performed key cleaning operations:
  - Removed duplicate records
  - Handled missing values using imputation or removal
  - Standardized column formats (e.g., dates, text case)
- Ensured consistency and accuracy across business list, license list, and location list datasets.
- Saved the cleaned outputs to Amazon S3 for further processing and cataloging.

## 4. Data Cataloging

- Used **AWS Glue Data Catalog** to register and organize cleaned datasets.
- Created metadata tables for business, license, and location datasets.
- Enabled fast data discovery and schema management for querying in Athena.
- Ensured consistent naming and logical partitioning for efficient access.
- Simplified data retrieval across multiple AWS services for analytics.
