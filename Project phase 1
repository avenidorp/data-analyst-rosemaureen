# Project Title:
AWS Data Analytics Platform for the City of Vancouver (Phase 2)

## Introduction

With the foundation built in Phase 1, Phase 2 of the project enhances the City of Vancouver‚Äôs Data Analytics Platform (DAP) by introducing advanced capabilities in **Data Analysis, Security, Governance, and Monitoring**. This phase aligns with AWS Well-Architected Framework pillars, focusing on operational excellence, performance efficiency, security, reliability, and cost optimization. The enhancements provide a reliable, secure, and insightful data ecosystem to support public service delivery and informed policymaking.

---

## Objective

To extend the capabilities of the existing AWS-based DAP by enabling secure, governed, and monitored data operations while delivering actionable insights through analytics.

---

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Amazon S3** ‚Äì Storage for raw, transformed, and curated datasets  
- **AWS Glue & DataBrew** ‚Äì Data cleaning, transformation, and ETL workflow  
- **Amazon Athena** ‚Äì SQL-based querying for on-demand insights  
- **AWS CloudWatch** ‚Äì Performance monitoring and alarm management  
- **AWS CloudTrail** ‚Äì Logging and auditing user activity  
- **AWS KMS** ‚Äì Encryption key management for data protection  
- **AWS IAM** ‚Äì Identity and access management  

---

## Phase 2 ‚Äì Methodology & Key Steps

### üîç Step 5: Data Analysis

- Used **AWS Glue DataBrew** to clean and standardize datasets.
- Executed **Athena SQL queries** to uncover trends like:
  - Average number of employees
  - Business types by location
  - Monthly growth of new licenses
- Delivered insights that support city planning and public transparency.

---

### üîê Step 6: Data Security

- Applied **KMS encryption** across all buckets (raw, transformed, curated).
- Enabled **bucket versioning** and **cross-bucket replication** to ensure data durability.
- Secured access via IAM roles and enforced compliance best practices.
- Protected sensitive information such as business names, addresses, and contact details.

---

### üß≠ Step 7: Data Governance

- Implemented **data quality checks** using AWS Glue ETL:
  - Verified completeness, uniqueness, and freshness of records.
  - Automatically routed passed data to ‚ÄúPassed‚Äù folders and flagged failed entries.
- Ensured that only high-integrity data was used in reporting and analysis.
- Created metadata tables with AWS Glue Data Catalog for traceability.

---

### üìà Step 8: Data Monitoring

- Deployed **CloudWatch dashboards** to track:
  - S3 bucket size
  - Glue job performance
- Configured **CloudWatch Alarms** with SNS notifications for usage threshold breaches.
- Enabled **CloudTrail** to log user activity and detect unauthorized access or changes.
- Ensured visibility, accountability, and system health across the data platform.
